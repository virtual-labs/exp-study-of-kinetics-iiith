**Pre-Assignments:**

1. What property of metal particles is used in the study of their formation kinetics?
2. Why do gold particles absorb light?
3. Why should one use a relatively weak reducing agent like ascorbic acid in the particle enlargement reaction?
4. Why does one need to use gold particles in the reduction of eosin by sodium borohydride?

**Post-Assignments:**

1. Do you observe any induction period for the commencement of eosin reduction reaction?
2. How do you explain the purple color of dispersed gold particles?
3. What happens to the color of gold particles after its participation in the catalysis?
4. What happens to the color of eosin after its particle catalyzed reduction by sodium borohydride?
5. Does the particle enlargement reaction follow autocatalytic growth over the entire duration of development?
